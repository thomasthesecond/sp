## surgerypartners.com vs. surgery-partners.com

It appears http://www.surgerypartners.com/ and http://www.surgery-partners.com/ are the same site.

Redirects must be set up to resolve the issue.

**Issues:**
* Google uses both URLs https://cl.ly/0Z3n2N1a1e0e
* No canonical URL

All traffic should be redirected to https://www.surgerypartners.com/. This includes:

* Non-www URLs
* Non-https URLs
* All surgery-partners.com URLs

## 301 redirects

301 redirects will need to be configured after the new URL structure is defined.
