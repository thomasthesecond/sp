title: Design Tokens
---
Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

Design tokens are split into the following groups:

* Background color
* Text color
* Border color
* Typography
* Opacity
* Spacing
* Radius
* Sizing
* Shadow
* Time
* Media query
* Z-index
