The investors pages included within the pattern library are to be integrated by the team at NASDAQ.

In the templates provided to NASDAQ, the URLs in the header and footer navigation, as well as the location finder in the footer, are likely incorrect. The URLs for the new website are yet to be determined. The Surgery Partners team will communicate the new URLs to the NASDAQ team when they are known.

The links that will need to be updated are located in the following places:

* Header navigation: `<nav class="Navigation">…</nav>`
* Footer navigation: `<nav class="Contentinfo-links">…</nav>`
* Footer location finder: `<select id="footer-locations">…</select>`
