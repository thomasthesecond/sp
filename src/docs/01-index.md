title: FooCorp Components
---
This is the component library for FooCorp. **Feel free to look around!**

## Atomic design

This component library uses [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles which classifies components into five distinct groups:

* atoms
* molecules
* organisms
* templates
* pages

## Naming components

Components follow the [SUIT CSS](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md) naming convention.
