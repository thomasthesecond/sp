title: Atomic Design
---
This component library uses [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) principles which classifies components into five distinct groups:

* **Atoms** of interfaces serve as the foundational building blocks that comprise all user interfaces.
* **Molecules** are relatively simple groups of UI elements functioning together as a unit.
* **Organisms** are relatively complex UI components composed of groups of molecules and/or atoms and/or other organisms.
* **Templates** are page-level objects that place components into a layout and articulate the designâ€™s underlying content structure.
* **Pages** are specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real representative content in place.
