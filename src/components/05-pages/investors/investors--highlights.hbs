        The Board of Directors of Surgery Partners (the “Company”) sets
        high standards for the Company's employees, officers and
        directors. Implicit in this philosophy is the importance of
        sound corporate governance. It is the duty of the Board of
        Directors to serve as a prudent fiduciary for shareholders and
        to oversee the management of the Company's business. To fulfill
        its responsibilities and to discharge its duty, the Board of
        Directors follows the procedures and standards that are set
        forth in these guidelines. These guidelines are subject to
        modification from time to time as the Board of Directors deems
        appropriate in the best interests of the Company or as required
        by applicable laws and regulations.
