      "quote": "Surgery Partners has made an excellent partner for Vanderbilt University Medical Center in development and management of a freestanding outpatient surgery center. Their seasoned team of professional healthcare surgery center managers has allowed us to expand into a community based surgery arena in which health systems generally do not have a great deal of experience. This environment has been a quality, cost effective enterprise appealing to patients, surgeons and staff.",
