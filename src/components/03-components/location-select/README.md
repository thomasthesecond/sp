# Location select component

This component has a select element with an `onchange` event that navigations to the selected stateâ€™s location listing page. Each `option` value of the select should be the URL each state listing page.

If JavaScript is disabled or has not loaded, then an anchor will appear instead of a select element and the anchor will link to the locations landing page, e.g. /locations.

The URLs used for this component will likely need to be changed when the back-end and routing is built.
